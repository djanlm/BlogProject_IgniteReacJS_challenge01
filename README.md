This is a blog project built using nextJS. the posts of the blog
are created and stored using prismic. [https://prismic.io/]
I also added the comment feature using utterance where
we can add comments that will be stored on Github.[https://utteranc.es/] [https://github.com/utterance/utterances/issues/161].

To try the project clone the repository and run yarn to install all dependencies. To
run it type the command yarn dev
